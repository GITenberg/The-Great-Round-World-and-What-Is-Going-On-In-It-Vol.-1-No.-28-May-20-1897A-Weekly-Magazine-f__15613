<p>Every one has some sort of an atlas, doubtless, but an old atlas is no
better than an old directory; countries do not move away, as do people,
but they do change and our knowledge of them increases, and this atlas,
made in 1897 from <b>new</b> plates, is perfect and up to date and covers every
point on</p>

<h3>The Great Round World.</h3>

<p>Those not subscribers should secure the subscription of a friend and remit
$5 to cover it and their own. A copy of the atlas will be sent to either

<p>On Saturday, May 1st, the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was formally
opened.</p>

<p>The object of this Exposition is to celebrate the anniversary of the
admission of the State of Tennessee into the Union, one hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Tennessee is the first State thus to celebrate its centennial.</p>

<p>The ceremonies at the opening of the Exposition were very simple; they
had, however, one interesting feature.</p>

<p>After the Governor of the State and other important persons had spoken,
Mr. Thomas, the President of the Exposition company, came forward and
dictated the following telegram:</p>

<p>&quot;To the President of the United States of America, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>&quot;The people of the State of Tennessee send greetings, and request that you
now put in motion the machinery of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause after the message was flashed over the wire. The people
waited breathlessly, and <a name="Page_786" id="Page_786"></a>then, amidst tremendous applause, the machinery
began to move. President McKinley had received the message and answered
it.</p>

<p>To make this great feat possible, wires had been laid, connecting the
Exposition with Washington; and they had been so arranged that the
pressure of the President's finger on an electric button would start the
current and put the machinery in motion.</p>

<p>Like the World's Fair, the Tennessee Exposition was not quite completed
when opened; but it appears to be a great success from an artistic
standpoint.</p>

<p>The various buildings are modelled after the most celebrated specimens of
Greek and Roman architecture. The grounds are beautifully laid out, and
the spot selected for the Fair abounds in natural beauties which the
gardeners have used to the very best advantage.</p>

<p>One of the wonders of the Fair is the great see-saw.</p>

<p>This is described as being an iron tower seventy-five feet high, across
which a great beam of iron is balanced. To each end of this a large car is
attached; and the beam see-saws, lifting the cars up and down. When one
car is on the ground, the other is lifted ever so high up in the air.</p>

<p>Each car is made to hold fifty people.</p>

<p>The see-saw is not allowed to move quickly, for fear of frightening
people, but is arranged so that it lifts the cars very slowly into the
air, gives the passengers a good opportunity to look at the magnificent
view of the surrounding country, and then carries them gently down to the
ground again, with a motion so slight that it can hardly be felt.</p>

<p>The Leeward Isles have just been visited by a series <a name="Page_787" id="Page_787"></a>of earthquakes,
which have been felt throughout the entire chain of islands.</p>

<p>The Leeward Islands are a part of the group of islands which form the West
Indies. They are in the Caribbean Sea, and lie to the southeast of Cuba.</p>

<p>The first shocks were felt on April 22d, and continued throughout the
entire week. The most severe quakings were felt three days later, when
great damage was done.</p>

<p>The people of Antigua were so badly frightened that all business was
brought to a standstill. Special services were held in the churches; and
when the shocks had passed over, a thanksgiving was offered to the
Almighty.</p>

<p>So great was the terror throughout the islands that the people deserted
the land, and went to sea in small boats. But even the sea was unfriendly
to them, for the earthquake was accompanied by a tidal wave, which wrecked
many of the small craft. The seas rose to a great height, and swept over
the land, doing much damage.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people are supposed to have been killed during this
catastrophe, but the full extent of the damage is not yet known.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hawaiian affairs are occupying a good deal of attention at this time.</p>

<p>In No. 26 of <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>, we spoke of the invasion by
Japanese immigrants, and how the government of the Sandwich Islands sent
the last few shiploads back to their own country.</p>

<p>The Japanese are extremely indignant at this action on the part of
Hawaii.<a name="Page_788" id="Page_788"></a></p>

<p>The newspapers in Japan are calling upon the government to send war-ships
to teach the Hawaiians that Japan insists upon fair treatment for her
citizens.</p>

<p>In Japan, there is some talk of sending the emigrants back to Hawaii, with
a demand that they be permitted to land. It is suggested that the Japanese
Minister in Honolulu shall demand money damages from the Hawaiian
government if these emigrants are refused the right of entry.</p>

<p>The Japanese think that the action of the Hawaiian government was
suggested by the United States, and that it is only the first step to the
annexation of these islands by us.</p>

<p>Japan declares herself opposed to such a union, and will do her best to
prevent it.</p>

<p>The Japanese in the islands have become very bold and defiant.</p>

<p>They have been holding mass-meetings, and denouncing the action of the
government in very strong terms.</p>

<p>It would seem that the Hawaiian government had acted none too soon in the
Japanese immigration question, for, were the Japanese stronger in numbers,
the indications are that they would try and take possession of the
Sandwich Islands for themselves.</p>

<p>The cruiser <i>Philadelphia</i> has arrived in Honolulu. She has been sent to
this post to protect our citizens in the islands, in case of trouble with
Japan.</p>

<p>The <i>Marion</i> is also stationed at Hawaii, and the Secretary of State
considers the situation so serious that he will keep two of our
war-vessels on duty there, until all fear of disturbance is passed.</p>

<p>The people of Hawaii, as we have already told you, <a name="Page_789" id="Page_789"></a>are most anxious to be
annexed to the United States; and it appears as if President McKinley were
willing to consider the proposal, though he has said nothing publicly to
that effect.</p>

<p>It is, however, fully understood that he will take no steps whatever until
after the Tariff Bill has been disposed of.</p>

<p>In Hawaii, they seem to be expecting that each incoming steamer will bring
a Minister from the United States, who will be authorized to conclude the
annexation treaty.</p>

<p>A story is told that an officer of the Hawaiian National Guard wished to
resign his commission. The President of the Hawaiian Islands, Mr. Dole,
hearing of it, urged him to remain.</p>

<p>The officer said he had seen enough service, and would prefer to retire
and make way for a younger man.</p>

<p>The President is said to have answered him:</p>

<p>&quot;I shall consider it a personal favor if you will remain until after the
annexation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How long will that be?&quot; asked the officer.</p>

<p>&quot;It is very close at hand,&quot; was the President's reply.</p>

<p>This looks as if we would have great news from the Sandwich Islands ere
long.</p>

<p>This probability of annexation explains the reason why Queen Liliuokalani,
the Queen of the Sandwich Islands, has been in Washington this winter.</p>

<p>You remember that we told you how President Cleveland tried to restore to
her her lost throne, and that he failed to do so.</p>

<p>When the Queen arrived in Washington this season it was at once supposed
that she had come for some <a name="Page_790" id="Page_790"></a>purpose; and either intended to make friends
with the incoming President, or to persuade Mr. Cleveland to make one more
effort to help her before he went out of office.</p>

<p>Her suite and advisers kept their counsel so closely, that no one could
find out the true reason for her visit. A few days ago, however, her
secretary stated that the Queen considered that the republican form of
government in the Islands could not last much longer.</p>

<p>She said that it had been hurriedly established when she gave up her
throne, and that the people are tired of it.</p>

<p>She declares further that it is this knowledge that is making President
Dole so very anxious for annexation.</p>

<p>She thinks that if the United States was made aware of the way in which
she was deprived of her throne, and also of the manner in which the Dole
government was established, there would be no further talk of annexation,
but that our government would help her to regain her throne.</p>

<p>Queen Liliuokalani is apparently in this country so that when the subject
of annexation comes up she may be on hand, and have an opportunity to
state her case to the Government.</p>

<p>Much interesting news about Hawaii has been brought out by these recent
events.</p>

<p>Col. R.H. McLean, who has just returned from the Sandwich Islands, where
he has been reorganizing the Hawaiian army, gives a very amusing account
of the state of things he found there.</p>

<p>He went to Honolulu in 1895, just after the insurrection to restore Queen
Liliuokalani was over.<a name="Page_791" id="Page_791"></a></p>

<p>On his arrival at the palace he found it fortified as if for a siege; the
grounds were bristling with big guns, which were all loaded, and ready for
instant firing.</p>

<p>Eighteen sentries were on duty, and 200 men were sleeping on their arms in
the basement of the building, while 100 more were ready to rush into
action at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>A thorough soldier himself, and accustomed to see such preparations only
in time of war, Colonel McLean asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>He expected to hear that there was a new revolt; but he was merely told
that the Queen was a prisoner inside the palace, and that unless these
precautions were taken, another rebellion might break out at any moment.</p>

<p>He had been previously told that the citizens were in a state of panic,
and that the natives were sullen and discontented. He thought there might
be some grounds for the fear of a revolt, and decided that he had better
examine his defences.</p>

<p>Walking round among the guns, he noticed that they were pointed at various
groups of houses. He asked what these buildings were that lay in the line
of fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Just houses,&quot; he was told. &quot;Residences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do rebels or suspected rebels live in them?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; he was told. &quot;Citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>The Colonel was so astonished at this that he did not know what to say.</p>

<p>He didn't wonder that the people were dissatisfied and frightened.<a name="Page_792" id="Page_792"></a></p>

<p>For months they had lived with the knowledge that the big guns were
trained upon them, and that at any moment a careless or frightened soldier
might pull the lanyard, fire a cannon off, and blow half Honolulu to
smithereens.</p>

<p>He did not say much, but felt that he would have to make many changes in
affairs, and went to bed to think things over.</p>

<p>He was awakened in the middle of the night by cries of:</p>

<p>&quot;Hi! hi! hi! there! Say! It's half-past two.&quot;</p>

<p>It took him some time to realize that this was the soldierly manner in
which the Hawaiian army changed the guard, and when the truth finally
dawned upon him, he laughed himself to sleep over the comic army he was
called upon to reorganize and train.</p>

<p>The next day, to the horror of the people in the palace, he removed the
guns, and reduced the number of sentries to four.</p>

<p>There was a terrible outcry against this order. Those in the palace
declared their lives were no longer safe. The first night after guns and
sentries were taken away, they passed a night of terror, no one apparently
expecting to live to see the morning.</p>

<p>When, however, morning came, and they were all alive, they calmed down a
little.</p>

<p>So did the townspeople, when the guns were taken away.</p>

<p>When the Colonel made arrangements whereby the imprisoned Queen could get
a little fresh air daily, and no terrible consequences followed, he became
the most popular person in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The government decided that Colonel McLean was <a name="Page_793" id="Page_793"></a>a wonder for quieting the
citizens. The citizens were grateful to him for having had sense enough to
remove the guns; the supporters of the Queen liked him for making matters
more comfortable for her; and the army found that he knew what he was
about, and trusted him accordingly.</p>

<p>Colonel McLean has had three years of very hard work getting the soldiers
into order, but has left the army in a very different condition from that
in which he found it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The State Department has sent to Mr. Uhl, the United States Ambassador to
Germany, directing him to make a demand on the German Government for the
release of an American citizen named Mayer, who has been wrongfully forced
to serve in the German army.</p>

<p>This matter is of interest to us, because it shows us our rights as
citizens.</p>

<p>The father of this Mayer was a German citizen who came to this country,
lived here for a good number of years, and returned to his native land
when his son was between eleven and twelve years old.</p>

<p>The elder Mayer never took out his naturalization papers, and therefore
remained a citizen of Germany.</p>

<p>The younger Mayer was nevertheless an American citizen because he was born
here, and this is the point that interests us.</p>

<p>According to our law, all persons who are born within the boundaries of
the United States are American citizens. The nationality of the parents
makes no difference whatever, nor does it signify whether the father was a
citizen or not. The mere fact of being <a name="Page_794" id="Page_794"></a>born in this country is sufficient
to make a man an American citizen. The United States claims him, and
protects him if he needs protection.</p>

<p>When young Mayer's parents went hack to Germany they educated their boy in
German schools, and he grew up as a German boy.</p>

<p>When he came to be twenty-one years of age he was ordered to serve his
time in the German army. He refused to do this, on the ground that he was
an American citizen.</p>

<p>He was nevertheless claimed by the authorities and forced to join the
army.</p>

<p>In Germany there is a law, that every young man who reaches the age of
twenty-one must go into the army and serve as a soldier for two years.</p>

<p>The very day the young Germans come of age they are bound to offer
themselves for military service.</p>

<p>In many of the towns, advertisements are put in the newspapers giving the
names of the lads who are nearing the age of twenty-one, and telling them
where to report for duty.</p>

<p>In other places the military authorities send each young man an order to
report for duty on the morning of his birthday.</p>

<p>There is no avoiding this service, which was formerly for three years, but
has been changed to two.</p>

<p>The young men who do not answer the call are searched for, and, when
found, slightly punished.</p>

<p>Lads who are in foreign countries are ordered home. If they do not report
for military service within a certain space of time, they are punished
with an extra year of service.</p>

<p>When young Mayer was forced to join the German <a name="Page_795" id="Page_795"></a>army, he appealed to the
American Government to help him.</p>

<p>When the matter was brought to their attention, the German authorities
denied the right of the United States to interfere, saying that Mayer was
the son of a German subject, and therefore was a German citizen.</p>

<p>This Government has, however, made a formal demand for the release of
Mayer, and there is little doubt that the request will be complied with.</p>

<p>The trouble is not yet over for the trusts. You remember about the
Investigating Committee appointed to look into the affairs of the
different trusts. The members of this committee had a good deal of trouble
with the Sugar Trust.</p>

<p>Seven of the most important persons connected with the trust refused to
answer the questions asked them by the committee.</p>

<p>Among these men were such prominent persons as Henry O. Havemeyer and John
E. Searles, men who are known as Sugar Kings.</p>

<p>The impossibility of getting any information from these witnesses made the
work of the committee very difficult; and when the investigations were
over, complaints were made against the men who had given the trouble.</p>

<p>One of them, Mr. E.E. Chapman, a stock-broker, was arrested by the United
States Marshal, taken to Washington, and tried for contempt.</p>

<p>His offence was that of breaking the law which binds witnesses to give
their testimony before Committees of Congress with the same care that they
have <a name="Page_796" id="Page_796"></a>to exercise before the judges in the courts of law. A witness in a
law court who refuses to obey the court is guilty of contempt of court,
and can be fined or imprisoned as the court pleases.</p>

<p>Mr. Chapman was found guilty of this misdemeanor, and sentenced to thirty
days' imprisonment.</p>

<p>Having disposed of Mr. Chapman's case, the United States District Attorney
has sent word that he intends to try the other six refractory witnesses on
May 17th. From the printed accounts at the time of the investigation, they
all seem to have given as much trouble as they possibly could, and as Mr.
Chapman has been found guilty, the chances are that the others will be
also, and that the jail of the District of Columbia may contain some
distinguished millionaires before the month is out.</p>

<p>If we are to have Investigation Committees, it is just as well that people
should learn they are not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>New York has just had a visit from Chief Joseph of the Nez Perc&eacute;s Indians.</p>

<p>Next to the old Sioux warrior, Red Cloud, Chief Joseph is the most
prominent Indian alive to-day.</p>

<p>He came to New York at the special request of General Miles, and seemed to
be much interested in seeing the sights.</p>

<p>His real business East was in Washington.</p>

<p>He came on from the Indian Reservation in Washington Territory, where he
lives with 150 of his tribe, to ask permission to join the main body of
the Nez Perc&eacute;s in Idaho.</p>

<p>There are 1,000 of the Nez Perc&eacute;s in Idaho, and it <a name="Page_797" id="Page_797"></a>is the dearest wish of
the old chief's heart that he, and the remnant of the tribe that is with
him, may be allowed to go back and end their days in their old homes.</p>

<p>General Miles secured permission for Chief Joseph to come on to Washington
and tell the Government the wishes of his people. He obtained an interview
for him with Mr. Bliss, Secretary of the Interior, and also with the
Indian Commissioner.</p>

<p>The old chief feels sure that his request will be granted, because, as he
proudly says, he has come on himself to make it.</p>

<p>While he was in New York he went to see Buffalo Bill, William Cody, who,
as you probably know, was one of the most famous scouts the army ever had,
and who has done noble service for his country.</p>

<p>The chief saw the Wild West Show from Colonel Cody's box, and after it was
over went to the Indian quarters, and smoked the pipe of peace with the
Sioux Indians who travel with Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The Sioux have a great admiration for the Nez Perc&eacute;s, and their surprise
and pleasure at seeing the chief was unbounded.</p>

<p>The language of the two tribes is very different, but the Indians have a
sign language which they all understand, and Chief Joseph and his hosts
sat on the mats outside the tepee, and had a long session together,
communicating by means of signs.</p>

<p>The chief rode in the Grant parade, taking his place beside Colonel Cody.</p>

<p>King Humbert of Italy had a narrow escape the other day.<a name="Page_798" id="Page_798"></a></p>

<p>He was driving, when a man made a rush at the royal carriage, sprang on
the step, and tried to stab the King.</p>

<p>His Majesty happily saw the blow coming, and, rising, struck the man's
wrist. The dagger turned, and buried itself in the cushions of the
carriage.</p>

<p>There was great confusion for a moment. The crowds which lined the streets
rushed forward to the royal carriage; but the King's escort charged them,
and drove them back.</p>

<p>The King was very little alarmed, and ordered his coachman to drive on.</p>

<p>The would-be assassin was caught by the soldiers, and proved to be a
blacksmith, who is thought to be insane.</p>

<p>The news of the affair reached the palace before the King. When he reached
there he was greeted with shouts of welcome, and had to bow again and
again to show the people that he was safe and sound.</p>

<p>He appears to have treated the matter very lightly, and is reported to
have said to those who congratulated him on his escape:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was only one of the little accidents which happen to people of my
profession.&quot;</p>

<p>There was the greatest excitement throughout the city of Rome.</p>

<p>A large number of workingmen made their way to the palace, and asked to be
permitted to congratulate their sovereign.</p>

<p>Special thanksgiving services were held in the churches, and the entire
city gave itself up to rejoicing.</p>

<p>The excitement and enthusiasm must have been very great.<a name="Page_799" id="Page_799"></a></p>

<p>Crowds stood around the royal palace, and both King and Queen were obliged
to come out on the balcony to bow to the people, who cheered frantically,
and then joined in singing the royal hymn.</p>

<p>A friend of ours witnessed just such a scene as this in England many years
ago.</p>

<p>It was just after Queen Victoria had come to the throne.</p>

<p>One day, when she was out driving, a crazy man tried to shoot her.</p>

<p>The people of London were so excited about the matter that they could not
be made to believe that the Queen had escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>After her Majesty had bowed from her balcony and shown herself smiling and
unhurt, there was still a rumor that she had been wounded; and, fearing
some demonstration from the people, the young Queen's advisers thought it
best for her to appear in some public place and convince the people of her
safety.</p>

<p>It was during the opera season, and it was decided that her Majesty should
occupy her box there for a part of the performance.</p>

<p>The house was very crowded; and the opera was half over when Victoria
reached her box.</p>

<p>The great singer, Jenny Lind, was singing at the moment of her arrival,
and so entranced was the audience with the song, that it did not become
aware of her presence, until the singer broke off, silenced the orchestra
with a gesture, and walking to the front of the stage, made a low curtsey
to the Queen's box, and then lifting up her glorious voice, began to sing
the national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>The effect was electrical.<a name="Page_800" id="Page_800"></a></p>

<p>The orchestra took up the strain with her. The chorus rushed on to the
stage to join their voices to the hymn. The audience started to its feet,
women waved their handkerchiefs and wept with excitement; men shouted and
joined their voices to swell the great chorus.</p>

<p>The poor young Queen, whose courage had been tried enough during the day,
stood in the front of her box, bowing and smiling, until at last the scene
became more than she could bear; then she burst into tears, and had to
leave the opera-house.</p>

<p>The Dingley Tariff Bill was reported to the Senate on Tuesday, May 4th.</p>

<p>A great many changes have been made in it by the committee; and a great
many more are expected to be made before it passes through the Senate.</p>

<p>Germany is still declaring that, if the Dingley Bill is passed, she will
make such a tariff on American goods that our export trade with Germany
will be killed.</p>

<p>One of our consuls, however, writes us that there is a very small market
for American goods in Germany, and that our trade will not be very greatly
damaged if she does carry out her threat.</p>

<p>It seems, from the accounts given, that Germany buys very little from us
besides the raw material which she cannot get elsewhere; and so, if she
does make a tariff against our goods, it may not make much difference to
us.</p>

<p>They make a great deal of use of elephants in India.</p>

<p>You know, of course, that India belongs to England.</p>

<p>The title of Queen Victoria is Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and
Empress of India.</p>

<p>England is obliged to keep a great many soldiers in India, and the
elephant has gradually become one of the most important factors in the
Indian army.</p>

<p>When the British first occupied India, the soldiers used the elephants to
work on fortifications, to haul timber, and to do any work that required
great strength.</p>

<p>After a while, as they began to understand the creatures better, the army
officers gave them more important tasks, until at last an elephant
artillery corps was formed.</p>

<p>It is said of the animals in this company that they know as well what to
do as the best artillerymen, and will bring their guns in line with the
precision of old soldiers.</p>

<p>Their duty is to drag the heavy batteries and the guns of the siege-train,
which are extremely large and exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p>The elephants draw them as if they weighed nothing, and march along,
keeping steady pace with the soldiers.</p>

<p>These big beasts trample down and demolish any <a name="Page_802" id="Page_802"></a>barriers that are in their
way, and pull their loads through heavy mire without the slightest effort.</p>

<p>Before the plan of using elephants was adopted, the guns were drawn by
bullocks; but one elephant can easily draw a load which it would take
thirty bullocks to move. The elephants are very tractable and clever,
while the oxen are stupid, ill tempered, and hard to manage.</p>

<p>The elephants, despite their great strength, will not allow themselves to
be overloaded.</p>

<p>If they are worked too hard, or made to draw heavier weights than is
pleasant to them, they become sulky and will not obey orders. Their
drivers, therefore, have to treat them very kindly; and then they will do
all that is asked of them.</p>

<p>As soon as they have learned the work that is required of them, they will
do it at the word of command.</p>

<p>The British soldiers do not attempt to manage these big beasts themselves.
Natives are employed for this task, each elephant having his own special
attendant.</p>

<p>These Mahouts, as they are called, feed and care for the elephants, who
become very much attached to them, and pine terribly if their keepers are
changed.</p>

<p>It is reported that Mr. Henry Havemeyer is trying to build an American
Venice in the Great South Bay.</p>

<p>Two years ago he purchased a large tract of marshy land, which he has
drained, filled in, and which is now ready to be built on.</p>

<p>He will construct some handsome villas, facing a grand canal, and
separated from one another and also from the mainland by various other
water-ways.<a name="Page_803" id="Page_803"></a></p>

<p>Mr. Havemeyer's charming idea is not entirely original, however. His
Venice already has a very lovely rival in the West.</p>

<p>A charming little village has been built on sandbanks formed by the delta
of the St. Clair River, which delta reaches put into Lake St. Clair, about
thirty miles from Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>The houses of this village are all built upon piles, some rising clear out
of the lake, some having small yards around them.</p>

<p>A few trees and such flowers as will grow are carefully cultivated by the
inhabitants, and add to the charm of the place.</p>

<p>The only means of communication is by boat.</p>

<p>Steamers go down from Detroit at short intervals, many of the business men
in that city having their summer homes in this Western Venice.</p>

<p>After more than three months of consideration, the General Treaty of
Arbitration with Great Britain was rejected by the Senate on Wednesday,
May 5th.</p>

<p>From the moment the Treaty was first proposed it met with great opposition
in the Legislature, and many people predicted that the Senate would never
ratify it.</p>

<p>The feeling of the public was, however, so strongly <a name="Page_804" id="Page_804"></a>in favor of the
Treaty, that it was thought it would surely be ratified after certain
objectionable clauses were changed.</p>

<p>The Committee on Foreign Relations took the Treaty in hand to make these
alterations; and when it was reported back to the Senate, people hoped
that it was in a form that would be found acceptable.</p>

<p>This has not proved to be the case.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States requires a two-thirds vote for the
ratification of a treaty, which of course you understand means that
two-thirds of the Senators present must vote for it, or it is lost.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 5th, there were sixty-nine present when the vote was
called. Forty-three voted for ratification, twenty-six against it.</p>

<p>You will see by this that the Treaty was defeated by only three votes.</p>

<p>When this Treaty was signed at Washington in January, everybody rejoiced.
The United States was praised by all Europe for being the first nation to
take such an important step in the advancement of peace.</p>

<p>The leading papers declare that, in spite of the rejection of the Treaty
by the Senate, the American people are still in favor of it; and that, had
the matter been given to the people to decide, the result would have been
different.</p>

<p>The war in the East is practically over.</p>

<p>Report says the Greeks have appealed to Europe for help, and are now
willing to withdraw from Crete.</p>

<p>It was felt from the first that the struggle between Greece and Turkey
would be an unequal one, but the <a name="Page_805" id="Page_805"></a>well-known courage of the Greeks, and
the righteousness of their cause, made people hope that success would
crown their efforts.</p>

<p>Such has not been the case.</p>

<p>Disaster has followed disaster. At the critical moment the Greeks always
appear to have lost faith in their leaders, and to have behaved in a
disorderly and insubordinate manner.</p>

<p>The retreat from Epirus seems to have been very little better than the
flight from Larissa.</p>

<p>From Pharsala, after their fine and determined stand at Velestino, the
Greeks again retreated to Dhomoko.</p>

<p>Whether it be from fatigue, want of military training, or lack of proper
leaders, the Greeks seem to have been unable to withstand the advances of
the enemy.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it is too soon to say what action the Powers will
take in the settlement of Greek affairs. It is only certain that the
situation in Europe has been made very much more difficult by the apparent
sympathy of the Powers with Turkey.</p>

<p>The success of the Turks will certainly make them more difficult to
handle.</p>

<p>There is a rumor that some of the Powers would like to remove King George
from the throne of Greece.</p>

<p>An alliance is also spoken of between Russia, Germany, and Austria against
England and France.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem as if the troubles in Greece had stirred up so
much bad feeling that another and much more serious European war must soon
follow.</p>

<p>As for poor little Greece, if she has been obliged to appeal to the Powers
for help, she will have to be content with whatever terms they make for
her.<a name="Page_806" id="Page_806"></a></p>

<p>It is said that Turkey will not be satisfied unless she gets Thessaly back
again, and the boundaries of Turkey are made the same as they were before
the Treaty of Berlin.</p>

<p>Some people think that Turkey will not demand the return of Thessaly, but
that she will insist that Greece shall pay all the expenses of the war.</p>

<p>It is said that Russia and Germany will support Turkey in her claims.</p>

<h2>INVENTION AND DISCOVERY.</h2>


<p>Some clever person has thought of a very novel advertising scheme.</p>

<p>It is for use at night, and consists of a sign made entirely of small
electric lights, which is sent up into the air and held there by means of
balloons.</p>

<p>Advertisers have used the pavements under our feet for their signs, and
have disfigured some of our grandest rocks with their Sapolios and their
St. Jacob's Oils; pretty nearly everything on the face of the earth has
been made to serve their purpose. The heavens have thus far escaped, but
this new invention brings them also into line.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/27.jpg"><img src="./images/27-tb.jpg" alt="NONPAREIL" title="NONPAREIL" /></a></p>

<p>If it proves a success the glaring announcements of the bill-boards, which
annoy us by day, may be repeated in the sky at night; and the romantic,
peaceful heavens will be dotted all over with &quot;H.O. is the Best;&quot; and the
obnoxious &quot;Yellow Kid,&quot; with a hideous electric toe, will parade among the
stars undaunted and unchecked.<a name="Page_808" id="Page_808"></a></p>

<p>This fruit-cutter seems to be a very clever invention.</p>

<p>As you can see from the sketch, it opens like a pair of scissors. Its
blades are very sharp, and as it cuts the fruit, the blades pierce right
through the flesh until they meet the pit in the center. The curves in the
blade catch the stone and hold it fast, while the points and heels of the
blades overlap until they have cut entirely through the flesh.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/28a.jpg"><img src="./images/28a-tb.jpg" alt="Fruit Cutter" title="Fruit Cutter" /></a></p>

<p>This invention should save a vast amount of time, and be a boon to the
good housekeepers who put up preserves, not to mention the young folks of
the household who are called in to help.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This sketch shows a folding crate for transporting or housing bicycles.</p>

<p>It is a very ingenious affair, folding tightly up when not in use, and
taking up very little more room than an umbrella.</p>

<p>Opened, it looks like an ordinary crate&mdash;only made of iron instead of
wood.</p>

<p>It has a baseboard to which hinges are attached, and if desired it can
stand against the wall to hold the bicycle when not in use.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/28b.jpg"><img src="./images/28b-tb.jpg" alt="Bicycle Storage" title="Bicycle Storage" /></a></p>


<p>For packing and transporting it is joined by straps, and would seem to be
a very useful invention.</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM OUR YOUNG FRIENDS.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><span class='smcap'>Dear Editor</span>:

<p>    I am a subscriber to <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>, and read it
    with great interest every week. In No. 13 of <span class='smcap'>The Great Round
    World</span>, you published a picture of the iron statue of King
    Arthur by Fischer. Last summer we stopped for a short time in
    Innsbruck, and I saw the said statue in the Cathedral of that
    city.</p>

<p>    There was one thing which puzzled me considerably and I know
    that you will be willing to explain it. Why was the fleur-de-lis
    placed on the shield supplied to the statue? I can't see what
    possible connection Arthur could have had with France, for I
    always thought that the fleur-de-lis was not borne by any
    British sovereign until after the hundred years' war was begun.
    Since King Arthur is supposed to have lived in the fifth or
    sixth century it seems strange to me that he should have been
    supplied with a shield bearing a device of a so much later
    period. Since I know nothing of heraldry, I have been much
    puzzled by this, and would be very grateful for an explanation.
    I should like to mention three books which I enjoyed so much
    when I read them that I am sure they would be appreciated by
    many. They are Miss Yonge's &quot;Dove in the Eagle's Nest,&quot; and a
    &quot;Chaplet of Pearls,&quot; and the &quot;Caged Lion.&quot;</p>

<p>    Wishing <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span> continued success, </p></div>

<br /><br /></p>


<div><span class='smcap'>My Dear Katherine</span>:</div>

<p>In reference to your question about the fleur-de-lis on King Arthur's
shield.</p>

<p>It can have no heraldic meaning whatever, because armorial bearings were
not in use in England until long after the Norman Conquest.<a name="Page_810" id="Page_810"></a></p>

<p>The kings and the great barons chose certain devices for their seals; but
the same device was not used by the members of a family, nor was it handed
from father to son, until armorial bearings came into use.</p>

<p>The use of the fleur-de-lis is not of French origin.</p>

<p>It was used as an ornament on the sceptres, seals, and robes, not only of
the French kings, but of Greek, Roman, German, Spanish, and English kings,
and was a symbol employed by many noble families in various parts of
Europe.</p>

<p>Particular symbols have in all ages been assumed by various families of
mankind, civilized and uncivilized, but they have nothing whatever to do
with heraldry.</p>

<p>King Arthur was a legendary person, and his story is sung alike by the
bards of Wales and the minstrels of France.</p>

<p>According to the Welsh legends he was born in Wales, and went over to
Brittany in France, where he fought some of his famous battles.</p>

<p>According to the Breton (French) legends, he was the son of one of the
early Britons who fled to France at the time of the Saxons. He was born in
Brittany, and with the help of the Bretons went back to England and
wrested his kingdom from the Saxon's hands.</p>

<p>The reason for the fleur-de-lis on the shield may therefore be that the
sculptor chose to pin his faith to the Breton legend of the hero, and
therefore placed the symbol of France on the shield. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='smcap'>Editor</span>.</p>

<p>    I was interested about Princess Charlotte of Belgium. I hope you

<p>    I hope that Cuba will gain her liberty, and that Crete will free

<div><span class='smcap'>My Dear Lucy:</span></div>

<p>The graphophone is an improved phonograph, the cylinder being of hard
rubber instead of wax.</p>

<p>The phonograph was invented by Thomas A. Edison in 1877, and improved by
him about 1889.</p>

<p>It operates by means of a thin diaphragm set in vibration by the voice or
any other sound. It bears a stylus which records the vibration, on a
rotating, wax-coated cylinder, in a faint wavy line.</p>

<p>This line is sufficient, however, to guide the stylus over the same course
again, and agitate the diaphragm into reproducing waves of sound, similar
to those originally recorded.</p>


<p>The Editor is very much obliged to Dallas S. for his pleasant letter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='smcap'>Editor</span>.<br /><br /></p>



<p>In reply to Mrs. C.H. Parkhurst, we suggest that a letter of inquiry to
Mr. Ford will be the speediest way to ascertain where the combination tool
can be <a name="Page_813" id="Page_813"></a>procured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class='smcap'>Editor</span>.</p>

<h3>GREAT ROUND WORLD GAME OF STATES</h3>
<div class='center'>COPYRIGHT, 1897<br />
By William Beverley Harison<br /><br />
<i>Complete in handsome box, price 50 cents, post-paid</i>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">A new and delightful game has just been invented. It is called
    &quot;The game of States.&quot; The directions have been written
    exclusively for <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>; they are as
    follows:</div>


<div class='center'><br /> <i>DIRECTIONS</i></div>

<p>This game may be played by four, six, or eight players. Two players toss
up for the first choice of partners; the winner also has the right for his
side to be &quot;call&quot; or to &quot;reply.&quot;</p>

<p>After sides are chosen the winner of the toss consults with his side, and
they decide whether they will &quot;call&quot; or &quot;reply.&quot; &quot;Call&quot; is considered the
better position.</p>

<p>The game is played with a map of the United States made of perfectly plain
pasteboard with each State a separate piece, and without names or marks of
any kind on the pieces.</p>

<p>This map should be large enough to have Rhode Island about one inch long,
and the game should be played around a table with the sides named North,
South, East, and West.</p>

<p>The side which &quot;calls&quot; takes all of the States in a box. When &quot;time&quot; is
called by the &quot;reply&quot; side, the &quot;calls&quot; must put a State on the table, and
the &quot;replys&quot; must name it and give the position it occupies before the
time-keeper of the &quot;calls&quot; can count 25; if the name or position is not
correctly given, the &quot;calls&quot; must themselves name the State and its
position, and place it on the table in about the position it will occupy
when all the pieces are in place; if they do this, they score.</p>

<p>For instance: The State of Massachusetts is put out, and the &quot;replys&quot; name
it &quot;Massachusetts&mdash;Northeastern part,&quot; and count one. This is continued
until the entire map is complete.</p>

<p>As maps may be obtained which have the Great Lakes also cut out, it is
great fun to see the mistakes made.</p>

<p>The &quot;calls&quot; or &quot;replys&quot; will frequently in playing it turn a state upside
down; this counts against the side making the mistake.</p>

<p>The game may be varied by putting one State on the table and calling for
&quot;next North,&quot; &quot;next South,&quot; &quot;next East,&quot; etc., when the name of the State
occupying that position must be correctly given.</p>

<p>The side having the greatest number of points wins the game.<a name="Page_814" id="Page_814"></a></p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
